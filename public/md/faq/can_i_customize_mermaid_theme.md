# Can I customize mermaid theme?

`mermaid.js` theme can be set as you like.  
Let me show you how to set `dark` theme for example.  
See [mermaid.js theming](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/theming) for the themes.

``` javascript
MdBook.start({
  mdFiles: {},
  mermaid: {
    theme: "dark"
  }
});
```
